general repository of DFT code
1)Create a working parser
2)Decide the user interface (input files, automatic imput files to be created like yambo, interface with python??)
3)Read wavefunction files

Also:
1)Start from parser and details rather than core routines, 
make it easy, clear and clean first, make it work later!!
2)Integrate a symmetry analysis library
3)Write doc during coding on-the-fly, COMMENT EVERYTHING

Coding conventions:
1)Structure everything to fit in a "Workflow" class
2)Implement Rust-like safety measures
3)No Fortran except for linear algebra libs
4)iterators always start with idx_ followed by the name in PascalCase
4bis)Use long and explicative names for variables in snake_case or PascalCase
4ter) use camelCase only for classes, structs and unions
4quater) critical variables concerning exclusively parallelization and GPU porting can be in CAPS_LOCK 
5)Keep track of input and output types
6)No namespaces ?
7)code shall be in english, no functions like "errore" in QE
7bis) critical comments can be translated in any language
